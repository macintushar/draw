Draw is a wrapper around Excalidraw, integrated with Supabase to save and sync your drawings seamlessly across different devices. It allows you to use Excalidraw anywhere while keeping your data available everywhere.

## Features

- **Excalidraw Integration:** Leverages the functionality of Excalidraw, a popular web-based drawing tool.
- **Supabase Backend:** Uses Supabase for authentication and storage, ensuring secure access and synchronization of your drawings.
- **Cross-Platform Sync:** Access your drawings from any device by securely saving them to your Supabase database.

## Acknowledgments

- [Excalidraw](https://excalidraw.com/) for providing the best open-source drawing tool. This wouldn't be possible without them (literally).
- [Supabase](https://supabase.com/) for their backend services.
- [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/) for allowing me to build super fast with the help of their UI components and blocks.

## Getting Started

### Usage

- **Sign Up or Log In:** Use the authentication flow provided by Supabase to sign up or log in.
- **Create and Edit Drawings:** Use the Excalidraw interface to create or edit drawings.
- **Save Drawings:** Drawings are automatically saved to your Supabase database.
- **Access Anywhere:** Log in from any device to access and sync your drawings.
